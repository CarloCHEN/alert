### Business Logic & Access Control

#### Tier Validation System
```python
# Customer attempting to access higher tier
customer_tier = "basic"
optimization_level = "enterprise"
# Result: ❌ Access Denied + Upgrade prompt

# Customer within limits
customer_tier = "professional"
optimization_level = "professional"
work_orders = 150  # Within 200 limit
# Result: ✅ Access Granted

# Customer exceeding work order limits
customer_tier = "basic"
work_orders = 75  # Exceeds 50 limit
# Result: ❌ Work order limit exceeded
```

#### Monthly Usage & Billing
```python
# Customer within included optimizations
monthly_usage = 5
customer_tier = "basic"  # 10 included
# Result: $0.00 (5 remaining this month)

# Customer exceeding included optimizations
monthly_usage = 15
customer_tier = "basic"  # 10 included
work_orders = 25
# Result: $7.50 ($5 base + $2.50 work order cost)
