```python
# Test pattern-based recommendations
customer_tier = "professional"
criteria = {
    'work_order_types': ['maintenance'],
    'min_confidence': 0.8,
    'buffer_days': 3,  # Recommend 3 days early
    'lookback_days': 60  # Longer history for better patterns
}

# Test emergency response recommendations
criteria = {
    'alert_severity_threshold': 'severe',
    'work_order_types': ['emergency_response'],
    'min_confidence': 0.6,  # Lower threshold for urgent items
    'buffer_days': 0  # Immediate recommendations
}
```

## 🔮 Database Integration

### Database Schema Integration
The system integrates with your existing work order database schema:

#### **Table Integration:**
- **Table 1 (WORK_ORDERS)**: Historical completion patterns, template relationships
- **Table 2 (Completion Data)**: Quality/efficiency scores for pattern validation
- **Table 8 (Alerts)**: Active alert monitoring and trigger detection
- **Metrics Tables**: Performance baseline establishment and degradation detection
- **Employee Tables**: Availability, skills, and capacity analysis

#### **Key Query Patterns:**
```sql
-- Historical pattern analysis
SELECT template_id, location, AVG(DATEDIFF(actual_end_time, LAG(actual_end_time))) as avg_interval
FROM work_orders
WHERE status = 'completed' AND template_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY template_id, location

-- Alert trigger detection
SELECT location_id, COUNT(*) as alert_count, MAX(severity) as max_severity
FROM alerts
WHERE status = 'active' AND timestamp > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
GROUP BY location_id

-- Performance degradation detection
SELECT location_id, data_type, AVG(value) as recent_avg
FROM metrics
WHERE timestamp > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY location_id, data_type
```
